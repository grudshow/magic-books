First, she tried to look down and make								out what she was								coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and								noticed that they								were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon								pegs. She took								down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her								great								disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so								managed to put it								into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								`Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling								down stairs! How								brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off								the top of the								house!' (Which was very likely true.)							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! `I wonder how many miles I've fallen by								this time?' she								said aloud. `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be								four thousand								miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her								lessons in the								schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as								there was no one								to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes, that's about the right								distance--but then I								wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or								Longitude either, but								thought they were nice grand words to say.)							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll								seem to come out								among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was								rather glad there was								no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to								ask them what the								name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she								tried to curtsey as								she spoke--fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage								it?) `And what an								ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see								it written up								somewhere.'							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. `Dinah'll								miss me very much								to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at								tea-time. Dinah								my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you								might catch a bat,								and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to								get rather								sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat								bats?' and								sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't								much matter which								way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was								walking hand in hand								with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a								bat?' when								suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was								over.							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it								was all dark								overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying								down it. There								was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say,								as it turned a								corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she								turned the corner,								but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up								by a row of								lamps hanging from the roof.							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the								way down one side								and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was								ever to get out								again.							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing								on it except a								tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the								hall; but, alas!								either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any								of them.								However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and								behind it was a								little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her								great delight it								fitted!							</div>						</div>					</div>				</div>			</section>			<section class="test">				<div class="test__body">					<div class="test__container _container">						<div class="test__content">							<div class="test__title">Какой перевод слова “голова”?</div>							<div class="test__subtitle">Выберете один из вариантов ответа и нажмите кнопку “Проверить ответ”							</div>							<form action="#" class="test__form form-test">								<div class="form-test__radiobuttons">									<div class="form-test__radiobutton">										<input class="form-test__input" id="formOne1" type="radio" value="1" name="nameradio1" />										<label for="formOne1" class="form-test__label"><span>Ответ номер 1</span></label>									</div>									<div class="form-test__radiobutton">										<input class="form-test__input" id="formTwo1" data-true="1" type="radio" value="2"											name="nameradio1" />										<label for="formTwo1" class="form-test__label"><span>Ответ номер 2</span></label>									</div>									<div class="form-test__radiobutton">										<input class="form-test__input" id="formThree1" type="radio" value="3"											name="nameradio1" />										<label for="formThree1" class="form-test__label"><span>Ответ номер 3</span></label>									</div>									<div class="form-test__radiobutton">										<input class="form-test__input" id="formFour1" type="radio" value="4" name="nameradio1" />										<label for="formFour1" class="form-test__label"><span>Ответ номер 4</span></label>									</div>								</div>								<button type="button" disabled class="form-test__button">Проверить ответ</button>							</form>						</div>					</div>				</div>			</section>			<section class="rabbit-hole">				<div class="rabbit-hole__container _container">					<div class="rabbit-hole__content">						<div class="rabbit-hole__text">							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a								rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.								How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers								and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if								my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my								shoulders.

First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see								if								she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might end,								you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I								should be like then?'								And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for								she								could not remember ever having seen such a thing.							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at								once;								but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little								golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly								reach								it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one								of								the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with								trying,								the poor little thing sat down and cried.							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								`Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; `I advise								you								to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very								seldom								followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes;								and								once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of								croquet								she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two								people. `But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why, there's								hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and								found								in it a very small cake, on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.								`Well,								I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it								makes								me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I								don't								care which happens!'							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">								She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which way? Which way?', holding her								hand								on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find								that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but								Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,								that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.							</div>							<div class="rabbit-hole__paragraph">So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.							</div>						</div>						<div
